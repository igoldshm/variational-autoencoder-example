Why? Because it has the capability to abstract a compressed representation of the data, without the need to label the data. Moreover, the variational autoencoder estimates the latent/hidden states according to the leading neuroscientific approach that might explain the structure and function of the brain, starting from the very fact that we exist!\n\nThis capability to get a compressed representation out of the original input data has the potential to abstract meaning out of data. Something that we, humans, do every minute of the day. The higher brain functions translate lower-level sensory information (e.g. pixel blob on the retina) to meaning (e.g. it is an apple) and link all the various information around that meaning together. (e.g. I know how it tastes, or if we were talking about stock prices I know it is the company that makes iPhones). Something that we have not been able to replicate in artificial neural networks. Abstracting meaning or knowledge representation is still one of the key challenges in the field of artificial intelligence research. The variational autoencoder approach looks very promising.\n\nSo, if you are interested please keep on reading and upvote top right, leave a comment or contact me directly.\n\nFor a quick introduction of autoencoders please watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zKuYvjFFS8&t=3s), it gives you a good overview, and it inspired me to reproduce the steps taken in this notebook.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Table of Contents\n1.

It is a probabilistic autoencoder. Why is that important? Because according to the leading neuroscientific approach, the [Free Energy Principle](https://www.wired.com/story/karl-friston-free-energy-principle-artificial-intelligence/) (FEP) by [Karl Friston](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/), the brain is a probabilistic prediction mechanism, one that attempts to minimize the error of its hypothesis about the world and the sensory input it receives:\n\n+ The skull-bound brain needs to infer the world.\n+ The brain builds an internal probabilistic model of the world using Bayesian inference (the generative model).\n+ Discrepancies between the internal model (the prediction) and the sensory observations result in prediction error.\n+ The brain aims to minimize the prediction errors by minimizing the Free Energy. It can do so by improving perception, acting on the environment, learning the generative model, etc\n\nThe Free energy is equivalent to the negative of the Evidence Lower BOund (ELBO), the loss function of the variational autoencoder. That is why I started this notebook with: the variational autoencoder estimates the latent/hidden states according to the leading neuroscientific approach!\n\nI hope this point got your attention!\n\nUnderstanding papers published about the free energy has a steep learning curve.  I started a tutorial series on Kaggle which I positioned as [Free Energy Principle tutorial without a PhD](https://www.kaggle.com/charel/learn-by-example-active-inference-in-the-brain-1) and recorded my notes with examples to make it much more accessible.\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Jt5TANO.jpg\" width=800>\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n## Minimizing the Free Energy or minimizing the negative Evidence Lower BOund (ELBO)\n\nThe Free Energy bounds the surprise in the sensory observations (See [Appendix A.1](#secA1))\n$$\\mathcal{F}(y_{observation},\\zeta)= D_{KL}(q_{ \\zeta }(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})\\parallel p(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation}))-ln(p(y_{observation}))\\geq  -ln(p(y_{observation}))$$\n\nWhere the Free Energy is defined as:\n\n$$\\mathcal{F}(y_{observation},\\zeta)= \\int q_{ \\zeta }(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})ln(\\frac{q_{ \\zeta }(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})}{p(x_{hypotheses},  y_{observation})})dx_{hypotheses} $$\n\nBy minimizing the Free energy you will get:\n+ a better approximation of $q_{ \\zeta }(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})$ for $p(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})$, in other words $q_{ \\zeta }(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})$ becomes a more reliable approximation of the true hidden states (they are called hidden because they are not directly observable, hence they need to be inferenced). \n+ a lower surprise in the sensory observations $-ln(p(y_{observation}))$, thus the generative model becomes better generating the predicted sensory observations. In other words, a better internal world model.\n\nThe Free energy equals the negative ELBO, as you can see by comparing it with the ELBO definition in this paper [Auto-encoding Variational Bayes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6114.pdf) and corresponding [tutorial](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.02691.pdf):\n$$\\mathcal{ELBO}(y_{observation}; \\theta, \\phi)= ln(p_{\\theta}(y_{observation})) - D_{KL}(q_{ \\phi }(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})\\parallel p_{\\theta}(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation}))$$\n\nwhere $ \\theta$ and $\\phi$ are the neural network parameters of the encoder resp decoder.\n\nMinimizing the free energy by a gradient descent, equals maximizing the model evidence by gradient ascent on the ELBO, which equals minimizing the negative ELBO by gradient descent. I hope I didn't confuse everybody by now :-)  \nIn short, the Free energy (or negative ELBO) is the loss function of the variational autoencoder.\n\nThis loss function can be mathematically rewritten (see [appendix A2](#secA2)) as\n\n$$\\mathcal{Loss}(y_{observation};\\theta, \\phi)= \\underset{KL-loss, \\:divergence\\: from \\:prior}{\\underbrace{D_{KL}(q_{ \\phi }( x_{hypotheses}\\mid y_{observation} )\\parallel p_{\\theta}(x_{hypotheses}))}} + \\underset{reconstruction \\: loss}{\\underbrace{-\\mathbb{E}_{q_{ \\theta }(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})} [ln(p_{\\theta}  (y_{observation}\\mid x_{hypotheses}))]}} $$\n\nwhich you will often see in machine learning papers. It breaks down into 2 parts.  \n \nA reconstruction loss (second part of the above equation) forcing the decoded samples to match the initial inputs (just like in our previous autoencoder). Maximizing the reconstruction likelihood $\\mathbb{E}_{q_{ \\theta }(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})} [ln(p_{\\theta}  (y_{observation}\\mid x_{hypotheses})]$ -> minimizing the negative reconstruction likelihood -> minimizing the reconstruction loss of the variational autoencoder.\n\n$$\\mathcal{Loss}(y_{observation};\\theta, \\phi)= \\underset{KL-loss, \\:divergence\\: from \\:prior}{\\underbrace{D_{KL}(q_{ \\phi }( x_{hypotheses}\\mid y_{observation} )\\parallel p_{\\theta}(x_{hypotheses}))}} + \\underset{reconstruction \\: loss}{\\underbrace{binary \\: crossentropy \\: (input \\: image, reconstructed \\: image)}} $$\n\nA KL divergence loss (first part of the above equation) between the learned latent distribution and the prior distribution, acting as a regularization term to learn well-formed latent spaces. The probability functions are assumed to be Gaussian/Normal distributions, they can be mathematically efficiently described with just 2 parameters: mean ($\\mu$ - the average value of all points) and standard deviation ($\\sigma$ - the spread of the points, or can be referred to as $\\sigma^2$ - the variance ). Therefor you will find the $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ in the latent space of the variational autoencoder. Note that actually a full covariance matrix should be learned to build a true multivariate Gaussian model including covariances between the latent dimensions. However, a simplifying assumption is made that the covariance matrix only has nonzero values on the diagonal, allowing a simple vector in the latent space.\n\nWith Gaussian/Normal distributions the KL divergence simplifies to:\n\n$$\\mathcal{Loss}(y_{observation};\\theta, \\phi)= \\underset{KL-loss, \\:divergence\\: from \\:prior}{\\underbrace{-\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_j(1+log(\\sigma_j^2)-\\mu_j^2-\\sigma_j^2)}} + \\underset{reconstruction \\: loss}{\\underbrace{binary \\: crossentropy \\: (input \\: image, reconstructed \\: image)}} $$\n\nWhere j is the dimension of the latent space.

The smart trick is to sample a hidden state x via x = x_mean + x_standard_dev * epsilon, where epsilon is a random normal zero-mean distribution with standard dev 1.

For an extensive overview including the explanations, please visit the [Free Energy Principle tutorial without a PhD](https://www.kaggle.com/charel/learn-by-example-active-inference-in-the-brain-1) tutorial series.\n\n### Bayesian inference\n\nLet's define:  \n*  $p(x_{hypotheses})$ as the probability density of hypotheses x. \n*  $p(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})$ as the probability density of hypotheses x  given the observation y (conditional probability) \n*  $p(x_{hypotheses}, y_{observation})$ as the probability density of hypotheses x and observation y together (joint probability)  \n\nBayes' theorem can be derived from basic probability rules:\n\nSymmetric property:\n$$p(y_{observation} , x_{hypotheses})=p(x_{hypotheses},  y_{observation})$$  \nApply the product rule: \n$$p(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})p(y_{observation})=p(y_{observation}\\mid x_{hypotheses})p(x_{hypotheses})$$ \nWhich leads to Bayes' theorem:  \n$$p(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})=\\frac{p(y_{observation}\\mid  x_{hypotheses}) * p(x_{hypotheses})}{p(y_{observation})} $$  \n\n### Variational Bayesian Inference\n\nUnfortunately, we do have a challenge calculating the denominator $p(y_{observation})$ of Bayes' theorem. It can be easily seen by writing out (applying the sum rule, the probability of x equals the probability of the sum of the probability of x given y for all possible y) the denominator leading to equation [2a] for discrete variables or equation [2b] for continues variables:  \n$$p(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})=\\frac{p(y_{observation}\\mid  x_{hypotheses}) * p(x_{hypotheses})}{\\sum_xp(y_{observation}\\mid  x_{hypotheses}) * p(x_{hypotheses})} \\:\\:\\:\\:\\:   [2a]$$ \n$$p(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})=\\frac{p(y_{observation}\\mid  x_{hypotheses}) * p(x_{hypotheses})}{\\int p(y_{observation}\\mid  x_{hypotheses}) * p(x_{hypotheses})dx} \\:\\:\\:\\:\\:   [2b]$$ \n\nThe denominator normalizes the probability, in other words, you need to average over all possible occurrences of the sensory observations (how to even know all possible observations?). The part in the nominator: $p(y_{observation}\\mid  x_{hypotheses}) * p(x_{hypotheses})$ is just one of the cases of the denominator as is easily seen in the discrete equation. Let alone calculating an integral $\\int p(y_{observation}\\mid  x_{hypotheses}) * p(x_{hypotheses})dx$ for continues variables. Which is unavailable in a complex high dimensional real world, or requires exponential time to compute! In short, the denominator $p(y_{observation})$ is generally intractable.  \n\nThe solution in active inference is to invoke Variational Bayesian inference methods: a set of techniques to *approximate* the posterior  $p(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})$ probability density. Find a “recognition” probability density $q_{ \\zeta }(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})$ that approximates the target density $p(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})$. \n* From a family of “nice” probability densities, e.g. a Gaussian probability density.\n* Is specified by its sufficient statistics $\\zeta$ (e.g. for a Gaussian density: mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^2$)\n* Find the right $\\zeta$ such that $q_{ \\zeta }(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})$ is an approximation for $p(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})$, this can be done by minimizing the Free Energy (is equivalent to maximizing the ELBO).\n\n\n### The Free Energy or negative Evidence Lower BOund (ELBO)\n\nThe [Kullback-Leibler divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence) measures the difference between probability densities. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErfnhcEV1O8) gives an introduction to KL-Divergence.\n\nFor the brain making an internal model of the world $q_{\\zeta}(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})$ to approximate posterior  $p(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})$ probability density it needs to minimize KL with respect to the sufficient statistics $\\zeta$ (e.g. for a Gaussian density: mean $\\mu$, variance $\\sigma^2$)\n\n$$\\underset{\\zeta }{Argmin}\\:  D_{KL}(q_{ \\zeta }(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})\\parallel p(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation}))$$\n\nThe Kullback-Leiber is defined as:\n\n$$D_{KL}(q_{ \\zeta }(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})\\parallel p(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})) = \\int q_{ \\zeta }(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})ln(\\frac{q_{ \\zeta }(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})}{p(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})})dx_{hypotheses}$$\n\nsince $p(x,y)=p(x \\mid y)p(y)$  \n$$=\\int q_{ \\zeta }(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})ln(\\frac{p(y_{observation})q_{ \\zeta }(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})}{p(x_{hypotheses},  y_{observation})})dx_{hypotheses}$$  \nsince ln(ab)=ln(a)+ln(b)  \n$$= \\int q_{ \\zeta }(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})ln(\\frac{q_{ \\zeta }(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})}{p(x_{hypotheses},  y_{observation})})dx_{hypotheses} + \\int q_{ \\zeta }(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})ln(p(y_{observation}))dx_{hypotheses} $$\nsince there is no $x_{hypotheses}$ in $p(y_{observation})$  \n$$= \\int q_{ \\zeta }(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})ln(\\frac{q_{ \\zeta }(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})}{p(x_{hypotheses},  y_{observation})})dx_{hypotheses} + ln(p(y_{observation}))\\int q_{ \\zeta }(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})dx_{hypotheses} $$\nsince the integral over a probability density function equals one \n$$= \\int q_{ \\zeta }(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})ln(\\frac{q_{ \\zeta }(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})}{p(x_{hypotheses},  y_{observation})})dx_{hypotheses} + ln(p(y_{observation}))$$  \nsince ln(a/b)=-ln(b/a)\n$$= -\\int q_{ \\zeta }(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})ln(\\frac{p(x_{hypotheses},  y_{observation})}{q_{ \\zeta }(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})})dx_{hypotheses} + ln(p(y_{observation}))$$ \n\nThe Free Energy is defined as:\n\n$$\\mathcal{F}(y_{observation},\\zeta)= \\int q_{ \\zeta }(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})ln(\\frac{q_{ \\zeta }(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})}{p(x_{hypotheses},  y_{observation})})dx_{hypotheses} $$\n\nHence we have that\n$$\\mathcal{F}(y_{observation},\\zeta)= D_{KL}(q_{ \\zeta }(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})\\parallel p(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation}))-ln(p(y_{observation}))$$\n\nAnd since the KL-Divergence $\\geq $ 0 it follows that the Free Energy bounds the surprise in sensory observations: \n$$\\mathcal{F}(y_{observation},\\zeta) \\geq  - ln(p(y_{observation}))$$\n\nwhere surprise is defined in information theory as $- ln(p(y))$\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/V2eX3F2.jpg\" width=800>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='secA2'></a>\n## From Free Energy to the VAE loss function\n\nThe Free Energy is defined as:\n\n$$\\mathcal{F}(y_{observation}; \\theta, \\phi)= \\int q_{ \\phi  }(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})ln(\\frac{q_{ \\phi  }(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})}{p_{\\theta}(x_{hypotheses},  y_{observation})})dx_{hypotheses} $$\n\n$$= \\int q_{ \\phi  }(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})ln(\\frac{q_{ \\phi  }(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})}{p_{\\theta}(x_{hypotheses})p_{\\theta}( y_{observation} \\mid x_{hypotheses} )})dx_{hypotheses} $$\n\n$$= \\int q_{ \\phi  }(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})[ln(\\frac{q_{ \\phi  }(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})}{p_{\\theta}(x_{hypotheses})})-ln(p_{\\theta}( y_{observation} \\mid x_{hypotheses} ))]dx_{hypotheses}$$\n\n$$= \\int q_{ \\phi  }(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})ln(\\frac{q_{ \\phi  }(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})}{p_{\\theta}(x_{hypotheses})})dx_{hypotheses} - \\int q_{ \\phi  }(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation}) ln(p_{\\theta}( y_{observation} \\mid x_{hypotheses} ))dx_{hypotheses}$$\n\n$$= \\underset{KL-loss, \\:divergence\\: from \\:prior}{\\underbrace{D_{KL}(q_{ \\phi }( x_{hypotheses}\\mid y_{observation} )\\parallel p_{\\theta}(x_{hypotheses}))}} - \\underset{reconstruction \\: loss}{\\underbrace{\\mathbb{E}_{q_{ \\theta }(x_{hypotheses}\\mid  y_{observation})} [ln(p_{\\theta}  (y_{observation}\\mid x_{hypotheses}))]}} $$\n\n$$=\\mathcal{Loss}(y_{observation};\\theta, \\phi)$$","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}}]}
